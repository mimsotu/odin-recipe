    <h3>Did you know?</h3>
    <p>Keep the scurvy at bay! Strawberries are packed with vitamin C - even more than oranges!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the filling...</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g strawberries, hulled</li>
        <li>50g caster sugar</li>
        <li>25g ground almonds</li>
        <li>4 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the topping...</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>110g plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>75g cold butter, diced</li>
        <li>100g flaked almonds</li>
        <li>75g demerara sugar</li>
        <li>double cream, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Put the hulled strawberries into your pie dish (I use a round one) and sprinkle over the sugar, almonds and vanilla extract. Give the dish a good shake or two to mix the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Now for the crumble topping: put the flour and baking powder in a mixing bowl and rub in the cold, diced butter between thumb and fingers (or in a freestanding mixer or food processor). When youâ€™ve finished, it should resemble rough, pale oatmeal.</li>
        <li>Stir in the flaked almonds and demerara sugar with a fork.</li>
        <li>Tip the topping over the strawberry filling, covering the strawberries in an even layer and pressing the topping in a little at the edges of the dish.</li>
        <li>Set the dish on a baking sheet and bake in the oven for 30 minutes, by which time the crumble topping will have darkened to a pale gold and some pink-red juices will be seeping and bubbling out at the edges.</li>
        <li>Leave to stand for 10 minutes before serving, and be sure to put a jug of chilled double cream on the table alongside.        </li>
    </ol>
