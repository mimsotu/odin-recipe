    <h3>Did you know?</h3>
    <p>Rhubarb is full of fibre to help your tummy digest delicious crumble, as well as calcium and vitamin K to keep your bones and blood healthy. But don’t eat the leaves - they’re poisonous!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 sticks of rhubarb</li>
        <li>8 tbsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground ginger</li>
        <li>110g butter, softened</li>
        <li>110g demerara sugar</li>
        <li>200g plain flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180 C / 160 C Fan / Gas 4.</li>
        <li>Cut the rhubarb into 7½ cm long sticks and place on an oven tray. Sprinkle with 4 tablespoons of water and the caster sugar. Roast for 10 minutes. Sprinkle over the ginger and mix well.</li>
        <li>Fill an ovenproof dish about 4 cm deep with the rhubarb.</li>
        <li>Rub the butter into the flour then mix in the demerara sugar to make the crumble topping. Sprinkle over the rhubarb and bake for 35-45 minutes, or until the crumble topping is crisp and golden-brown and the rhubarb filling has softened and is bubbling.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool slightly before serving with double cream.</li>
