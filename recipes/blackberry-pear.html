<h3>Did you know?</h3>
<p>Blackberry jam is delicious. That’s it, that’s the fact.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>For the crumble topping...</h3>
<ul>
    <li>110g butter, cubed, plus extra for greasing</li>
    <li>180g plain flour</li>
    <li>25g ground almonds</li>
    <li>110g demerara sugar</li>
</ul>
<h3>For the filling...</h3>
<ul>
    <li>5 pears, peeled and left whole</li>
    <li>150g caster sugar</li>
    <li>300g blackberries (or frozen blackberries)</li>
</ul>
<h3>For the custard</h3>
    <li>4 free-range egg yolks</li>
    <li>40g caster sugar</li>
    <li>150ml milk</li>
    <li>150ml double cream</li>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>For the crumble, preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F / Gas 4. Grease an ovenproof dish with butter.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, rub the butter into the flour using your fingertips, until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the sugar, mix well, then set aside.</li>
    <li>To make the filling, place the whole pears in a pan, cover with water and add 50g of the sugar. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 10-12 minutes, or until the pears are tender. Drain well and set the pears aside to cool. Remove the pear cores and chop the flesh.</li>
    <li>Spoon one-quarter of the pears in an even layer on the bottom of the prepared ovenproof dish. Scatter one-quarter of the blackberries over the pears and then sprinkle over 2 tablespoons of the remaining caster sugar. Repeat the layering process until all the pears, blackberries and sugar have been used.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle over the topping and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden-brown and bubbling.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, make the custard. Place the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl and whisk until thick and pale.</li>
    <li>Place the milk and cream in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Pour onto the egg mixture, whisk well, then return to the pan. Heat gently, until the custard is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon.</li>
    <li>To serve, divide the crumble between serving bowls and pour the custard over.</li>
